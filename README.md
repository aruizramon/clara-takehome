### Clara Take-Home Interview

#### Brief
The project goal is simple: create an API that allows users to add events to a
calendar, preventing conflicting events from saving.

Time permitting, you can explore a few areas that you think are interesting. 

For the purposes of this project, ignore authentication completely. There's no
need to worry about the logged-in status of a user.

#### Setup
- Clone this repository (gitlab.com/clarahealth/takehome.git)
- Run scripts/init.sh [Ubuntu 16.04] or scripts/init_osx.sh [Mac OSX]
- Go.

#### Considerations
The project is intentionally open-ended, and designed not to be finished. You
should expect to spend 2-3 hours on the project - please don't spend more than
that. Lines of code is not a metric that matters, both for this project and at
Clara.
